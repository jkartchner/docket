# Docket Preparer

Docket Preparer is a script to scrape docket information for the following day in Denver Municipal Court. It provides extensive metadata regarding the cases set before the Court that are otherwise accessible by individually clicking through each Defendant's name. This is helpful to attorneys practicing criminal law in Denver Municipal Courts and Colorado state courts in general. Keep in mind this code will not be helpful to those who don't have access and accounts to the jbits or Denver court databases.
